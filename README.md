# Barebones Aesthetics Calculator

## What?

Hi! This is my first webdev project ~~and probably my last~~.

I initially embarked upon this journey because I wanted to get a taste of basic web development, but I didn't want to build some generic project... because knowing myself, I'd probably just end up looking for a YouTube video and copying it. :sweat_smile:

## Why?

I ended up settling for this project, because it is very relevant to me right now, and it actually does end up saving me time. Admittedly, it is barebones, however it is enough for my purposes, as well as getting me to realise that web development is not my cup of tea...?

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Roadmap

There are a couple of things I would like to add, but for now my brain is too small, and I would rather devote my time to other things. :3

Some things that I want to include are...
- a metric to imperial converter (using a cartoon bald eagle as my toggle)
(I did start but quickly abandoned this because it was more difficult than I thought...)
- a question mark to the left of each body part, and on hover would lead to a graphic denoting the way to measure said body part
(I couldn't find any graphics that illustrated what I wanted, at least not one type of art style for all the relevant body parts, and I didn't know how to deal with potential copyright issues...?)

I am open to more ideas or criticisms about my atrociously inefficient coding practices.
